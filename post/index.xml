      <description>In this project my aim was to classify the car brands by seeing the image of the car. I am using Deep Learning&amp;rsquo;s Resnet50 model architecture in this project. The final accuracy which I got after 50 epochs was 92.19%. Below graphs show the training and validation accuracy and loss      Link to GitHub Repository</description>

      <description>This is a Machine learning project. In this project I am trying to predict the fare of flights by training the dataset which contain data for one year. At first dataset required cleaning as most of the columns were categorical so I converted them into numerical. I did feature engineering to get dates months from the existing columns. I dropped the additional info and route columns as most of the values were missing or of no use.</description>

      <description>In this, we have to predict the number of positive and negative reviews based on sentiments by using different classification models. I have used three classification models. I observed that both logistic regression and multinomial naive bayes model performing well compared to linear support vector machines.  Link to GitHub Repository</description>

      <description>In this project, I am trying to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease with the help of news headlines. The dataset contains news headlines of sixteen years from 2000 to 2016. If the stock price increases it is labelled as 1 or if decreases it is labelled as 0. The dataset required pre text cleaning which I did with the help of regular expressions. I considered data upto 2014 as training data and from 2015 I took the data for testing.</description>

      <description>Here I have the dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. I am using Random Forest Regression model to predict the selling price of Cars.
  The dataset have 301 records and around 9 features.
  The dataset does not have any null values.
  I have calculated the age of the car by subtracting the current year with the feature Year which is the year in which car hit the road.</description>
